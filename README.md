## Description
    
This is a backend E-commerce repo which I made to further my knowledge of backend systems and SQL. I built this project to further understand MySQL, Sequelize, and ORMs. By doing so I am better able to build future backend systems and use this as a scaffold for them. Throughout this project, I learned more about routers, databases, and Sequelize.
